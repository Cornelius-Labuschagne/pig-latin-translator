# pig-latin-translator
A python cli program that takes english string input and outputs it into pig latin translated

you will need to have python installed
you will need to know how run a python script in the CLI

The program will accept any user input from the console
  1) you should only use a single paragraph
  2) prefferably there should be no punction
  
Once you have inserted your sample text, the program will displaya copy of your original sample as well as the translated sample after.
 
The script will auto translate and then end once you hit 'Enter'.
Currently you will have to reopen the script if you  want to translate again
 
I also created a Javascript version of this program
You can view it on Codepen here: https://codepen.io/corneliuslabuschagne/pen/mdeBQpb
 
The version on Codepen is much more efficient and will allow you translate as many times as you wish to.
